""" Homework 23rd August 2025:
List Manager Program
A. Create a program that will allow the user to easily manage a list of names.
 You should display a menu that will allow them to add a name to the list, 
 change a name in the list, delete a name from the list or view all the names in the list.
There should also be a menu option to allow the user to end the program. 
If they select an option that is not relevant, then it should display a suitable message. 
After they have made a selection to either add a name, change a name, delete a name or 
view all the names, they should see the menu again without having to restart the program. 
The program should be made as easy to use as possible.

B. Try reversing, sorting and slicing on the cartoons list
Slicing â€“ print element at index, 3 to 5   """
